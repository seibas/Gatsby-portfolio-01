A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions are executed when they are called. They can accept parameters (inputs), and can return a value (output). Functions can be reused multiple times in a program, making the code more organized and maintainable. Functions are declared using the "function" keyword followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that may include parameters. The code to be executed is placed inside curly braces "{}". An example is:
...
javascript
Copy code
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
...
