**Let's try to learn GitHub together!**
#let's get started! #

For some beginner GitHub is just a platform to upload the code.
It can easily be used as a collaboration platform among coders, and can be used to build complex systems.
So that explain that basically is a very useful tool to collaborate on the project so the team can easily check and merge the code anytime they want on the master file.
For me us beginner i use just for the blog like this one here so my focus is how to use GitHub for a blog.
