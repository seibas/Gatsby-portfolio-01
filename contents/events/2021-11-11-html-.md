HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It provides a structure for the content on a web page and uses a set of tags and attributes to describe and format text, images, videos, and other types of media. HTML is used to create the backbone of the majority of websites on the Internet.
