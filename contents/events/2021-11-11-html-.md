The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
If you're completely new in HTML I really sugest you yo study not just the basuc understanding of it but deep , becouse 
to know very well thw HTML for me is the best start!
There are so many books you can dive in and for the best free toutorial in internet you can anjoy!.
